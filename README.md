Official Code for MM'22 Paper "PixelSeg: Pixel-by-Pixel Stochastic Semantic Segmentation for Ambiguous Medical Images"

see ReadMe.txt for instruction to run the code

This code reproduces Table 1, Table 3, Figures 5-6, Figures 8-10 in the paper

This code is the original version I experimented with. I plan to reorganise the code this month to make it more readable
